On the Ritual of Recycling

The closed-loop economy of subterranean existence extends even to death. Bodies are reclaimed not as symbols of loss alone but as resources, integrated into composting systems that feed fungal farms or into converters that release methane for heat and light. For most communities, this is not a desecration but a civic duty, framed as a final act of service to the collective. 

Variations exist. Some factions mark the moment with solemn assemblies, names recited before the remains are consigned to the cycle. Others strip ceremony entirely, treating the process as clinical necessity. A few, more secretive, weave unsettling rites around the act, interpreting it as covenant or sacrifice. What unites them all is the refusal to allow waste. In the subterranean world, even the dead sustain the living, and memory is preserved less in monuments than in the very air and food that follow.
