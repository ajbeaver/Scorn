On the Politics of Air and Water

No commodity shapes the subterranean world so directly as air and water. Air is filtered, pumped, and rationed with relentless attention, for without circulation the tunnels suffocate in hours. Water, meanwhile, must be reclaimed, purified, and guarded with equal care. These necessities define political order as surely as any ideology or banner. 

Factions that control reservoirs or circulation plants are obeyed not out of loyalty but out of the basic arithmetic of survival. In disputes recorded by scribes, water allocations are the subject of assemblies more often than territory or trade. Even myths and sayings reflect this: to hoard water is treachery, to poison it unforgivable. The historian must conclude that while factions claim legitimacy in many ways, the ability to secure these two flows—air and water—is the true foundation of authority underground.
