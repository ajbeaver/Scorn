On the Fragmentation of Time

In the absence of the sky, the measurement of time has fractured into a dozen competing forms. Some settlements rely on mechanical clocks preserved from earlier eras, their gears worn but still serviceable. Others impose cycles according to the maintenance of pumps and filters, each cleaning or repair marking the passage of another interval. Factions engaged in trade often align their calendars to convoy schedules, while more insular groups create rituals tied to local eventsâ€”lighting cycles, council meetings, or even the phases of fungal growth.

This multiplicity produces confusion but also autonomy. A traveler moving between settlements may find themselves disoriented, their day doubled or halved depending on where they arrive. Disputes over synchronization are frequent, yet no consensus has emerged, for no authority holds sway over all. The historian notes that this fragmentation shapes identity as much as banners or rituals: to keep time by one rhythm is to declare allegiance, to submit to another is to acknowledge dependence. Thus time itself has become a contested field, a measure of belonging, and a reminder of division.
