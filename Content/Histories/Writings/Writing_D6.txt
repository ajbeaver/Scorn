On the Economics of Digging

The possession of machines capable of carving new tunnels is the true measure of wealth and strength underground. While food, water, and air sustain daily life, it is the ability to expand the habitable world that defines a factionâ€™s horizon. Old corporate tunnelers, patched and rebuilt beyond recognition, are jealously guarded. New contraptions, cobbled together from scavenged parts, serve as both tools and symbols of ingenuity. 

Control of these machines grants more than space. Digging exposes stone and soil that can be harvested, filtered, and sometimes processed for trace resources. It permits the redirection of airflow, the securing of hidden reservoirs, and the creation of defensible positions. Factions without such means are confined, their growth stunted, their people pressed into dependence on those who dig. In the subterranean world, the earth itself is the final currency, and those who move it write the map of power.
