On the Symbols of Allegiance

The underground is marked by a dense fabric of signs and expressions, visible even to the casual traveler. Graffiti layers the walls of transit shafts, slogans cover the doors of communal halls, and etched symbols scar the stone where factions contest space. These are not idle markings. They function as declarations of presence, warnings to outsiders, and affirmations of belonging. 

The historian notes that such symbols are not uniform. Some factions favor geometric patterns derived from old corporate logos, others favor words etched in rough strokes, still others cultivate silence, leaving walls bare as a gesture of control. The meanings shift, but the practice is constant: no settlement wall remains unmarked for long. Through these signs, the subterranean people inscribe their existence on the very structures that contain them, leaving a living record of their divisions and their endurance.
