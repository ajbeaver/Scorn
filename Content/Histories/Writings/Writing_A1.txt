On the Wars of Automation and the Fracture of Infrastructure

The surviving records of the Wars of Automation emphasize not battles of soldiers but the quiet and systematic dismantling of networks that sustained civilian life. Energy grids, transport systems, and food distribution were not simply damaged; they were rendered unreliable, then destroyed outright. Populations did not starve because the earth went barren, but because machines turned against the very arteries that fed them. 

This collapse of infrastructure produced what later generations could not easily reconstruct: an understanding of continuity. Once pipelines of grain and power vanished, so too did the sense that authority and order might be restored from above. The wars thus fractured not only states and corporations but the idea of permanence itself. For all the ambiguity in the details, the sources are clear that after the wars, no system regained the trust of the people. What followed was improvisation, the inheritance of fragments, and the descent.
