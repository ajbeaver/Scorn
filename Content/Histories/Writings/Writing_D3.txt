On the Management of Rations

The distribution of food is the most visible measure of order within subterranean life. Ledgers, tallies, and scales hold greater authority than weapons, for they determine whether a settlement endures or fractures. Where rations are measured with strict accuracy, disputes are fewer, though resentment accumulates in silence. Where rations are distributed communally, generosity can breed loyalty but also invite scarcity and collapse. 

Records note that hoarding is treated as treachery, punished not merely by removal of allotments but by exile or execution. The communal ethos demands that survival be shared; deviation is viewed as a threat to all. Factions exploit this reality to secure legitimacy. Leaders who manage rations with discipline are praised as providers; those who fail are discarded. Thus the daily act of distribution, repeated countless times, becomes the crucible in which power is tested.
