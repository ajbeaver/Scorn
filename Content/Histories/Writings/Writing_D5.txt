On the Silence of the Cults

Among the scattered records of subterranean life, few subjects are as difficult to document as the cults. They leave little behind beyond faint traces: markings carved into stone, circles of melted wax, or the sudden disappearance of those once present in daily assemblies. Their rituals are conducted in secrecy, their doctrines passed only to initiates. What is known is pieced together from rumor, fragments of testimony, and the fearful silences of those who refuse to speak.

The historian observes that the very absence of detail has become their greatest strength. Cults thrive in ambiguity, shaping themselves according to fear and expectation. Where famine rises, they speak of sacrifice; where collapse threatens, they preach renewal. To investigate too closely is to risk disappearance, for secrecy is enforced with ruthless care. Thus their silence itself becomes a kind of language, a mark of presence more telling than any proclamation.
