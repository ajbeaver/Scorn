Appendix E: On the Nature of Factions

Introduction

In the subterranean world, survival depends not on individuals alone but on the structures that bind them together. Factions are the most visible and enduring of these structures. They provide continuity where leadership falters, they secure resources where scarcity gnaws, and they enforce order where chaos threatens. Though they vary widely in scale, character, and endurance, all factions share certain traits that allow them to exist at all. This appendix seeks to describe those traits, to outline the ways factions are organized, and to explain the forms of authority by which they rise and fall.

Foundations of a Faction

Every faction, no matter how small or mighty, rests upon three foundational pillars: communal infrastructure, leadership, and a capital. The first pillar, communal infrastructure, refers to the essential anchors of survival that a faction must secure to persist. These may include access to water sources, reliable air circulation systems, or defensive measures sufficient to withstand environmental collapse or external threats. When a faction relies solely on a single, weak anchor—such as a fragile water source or a poorly maintained ventilation shaft—it faces inherent instability. Such factions often exist precariously, vulnerable to sudden environmental shifts or hostile incursions. The fragility of their infrastructure can limit their ability to expand or maintain cohesion, frequently resulting in transient or nomadic groups rather than stable entities.

The second pillar, leadership, is indispensable regardless of the faction’s size or structure. Leadership manifests in many forms, from singular charismatic figures to councils or hierarchies that share power. The nature of leadership shapes the faction’s internal dynamics and external relations. For example, a faction led by a single strong-willed leader may exhibit rapid decision-making but risk abrupt collapse upon that leader’s removal. Conversely, councils may provide stability through collective governance but struggle with internal disputes or slow responses.

The third pillar, the capital, serves as the symbolic and operational heart of the faction. Capitals vary widely: some factions center around a heavily fortified settlement, while others maintain a complex network of halls, tunnels, or resource nodes. The character of the capital influences faction identity profoundly. A sprawling, fortified complex may project power and permanence, attracting followers through displays of strength and organization. In contrast, a loosely connected network of outposts may foster a more decentralized identity, emphasizing flexibility and local autonomy. Capitals also function as centers of ritual and communication, reinforcing the faction’s cohesion and authority. Without a capital or comparable locus of control, factions tend to fragment or dissolve, as their members lack a shared point of reference or rallying symbol.

Variation in Scale and Organization

Factions exhibit a broad spectrum of scale and organizational complexity, ranging from small gangs to vast, multi-settlement coalitions. At the smallest scale, gangs or bands may control a single junction, cistern, or resource cache, governing a few dozen individuals through direct personal relationships, fear, or loyalty. These groups often rely heavily on informal leadership and fluid membership, making them adaptable but vulnerable to rapid disintegration.

Intermediate factions occupy a middle ground, controlling multiple settlements or resource nodes connected by established communication or trade routes. These factions typically develop more formal governance structures—such as councils, elders’ assemblies, or delegated leaders—to manage their affairs. The increased scale necessitates mechanisms for dispute resolution, resource allocation, and defense coordination. However, the complexity of these structures can also introduce fault lines, as competing interests or regional identities challenge overall cohesion. Such factions may experience periodic fractures or splinter groups, especially under stress or leadership crises.

At the largest scale, factions may span entire regions of the subterranean world, uniting diverse communities under a coherent political and social framework. These entities often maintain bureaucratic systems, codified laws, and institutionalized leadership orders. Their capitals are typically fortified hubs with extensive infrastructure, serving as centers of administration, trade, and cultural life. While their size grants them resilience and influence, it also exposes them to internal tensions, factionalism, and the constant need to balance central authority with local autonomy.

The scale of a faction directly affects its cohesion and propensity for fracture. Smaller groups benefit from personal bonds and rapid consensus but lack the resources for sustained defense or expansion. Larger factions command more resources and influence but must constantly negotiate internal diversity and the challenges of maintaining legitimacy across disparate populations. Intermediate factions often face the greatest challenges, straddling the demands of centralized control and local independence, making them particularly prone to cycles of growth and fragmentation.

Sources of Authority and Legitimacy

Factions derive their authority and legitimacy from a variety of sources, often combining multiple strategies to sustain themselves. These sources are rarely mutually exclusive and may evolve over time in response to changing conditions.

One common source of legitimacy is the control of essential resources. Factions that monopolize water supplies, air filtration systems, or food caches can trade these necessities for obedience and loyalty. For example, some councils maintain ration books that regulate the distribution of scarce provisions, using this system to enforce compliance and reward allies. Resource control provides tangible benefits that justify the faction’s rule but also imposes responsibilities to manage scarcity and prevent unrest.

Another source of authority comes from inherited symbols and practices. Certain factions claim continuity with pre-collapse corporations or institutions, adopting their iconography, rituals, and bureaucratic forms to legitimize their existence. These inherited traditions can confer a sense of historical weight and stability, appealing to followers who seek order amid chaos.

Protection and security form a further basis of legitimacy. Factions that offer defense against raiders, environmental hazards, or famine often garner loyalty as guardians. Cults or religious factions may reinforce this role through ritual practices that bind followers emotionally and spiritually. For instance, some cults perform elaborate ceremonies promising safety and renewal, intertwining belief with practical protection.

Ideological authority also plays a significant role. Factions may rally followers around visions of society, justice, or survival, using propaganda, rhetoric, and communal narratives to inspire cohesion. Tyrants often blend this ideological appeal with control of resources and propaganda, crafting personalities that dominate public consciousness through speeches, symbols, and staged events.

Finally, raw force and the threat of violence remain fundamental. Some factions rely on domination through intimidation, maintaining power by the constant possibility of reprisal. However, even these factions often supplement force with other legitimacy forms to ensure longer-term stability.

These diverse sources of authority interact in complex ways, shaping the faction’s identity, stability, and capacity to endure.

Succession and Continuity

Leadership succession is a critical and often fraught aspect of factional life. The methods by which factions transfer authority have profound cultural and political consequences, influencing how members view legitimacy, tradition, and stability.

Hereditary succession is common in some factions, where children or relatives of leaders are positioned as heirs. This approach can foster continuity and a clear line of authority but risks failure if heirs lack capability, charisma, or support. In such cases, factions may experience decline or internal conflict as rival claimants emerge.

Other factions employ elective or acclamatory systems, where councils or assemblies select leaders by vote or consensus. These processes can promote meritocracy and adaptability but are often fragile under conditions of scarcity or crisis, when disputes over legitimacy may escalate into violence. The rituals and traditions surrounding elections—such as public ceremonies or oaths—serve to reinforce the authority of chosen leaders and the legitimacy of the process.

In times of vacancy or crisis, deputies or lieutenants may assume leadership by proximity and precedent, often relying on personal networks and demonstrated competence. Charismatic individuals may seize power suddenly, their authority contingent on their ability to maintain support. Such figures can bring rapid change but also risk burnout or violent overthrow.

Violence frequently serves as an arbiter of succession. Assassinations, coups, and factional warfare are common means by which rivals claim leadership. These violent transfers shape collective memory, often becoming the subject of stories, myths, or cautionary tales that influence future succession practices.

Culturally, succession rituals and traditions reflect the faction’s values and history. Some factions develop elaborate ceremonies to sanctify transfers of power, while others accept abrupt or violent changes as inevitable. Instability in succession often leaves lasting scars, fostering cycles of mistrust, factionalism, and fragmentation. Nonetheless, the persistent effort to establish continuity underscores the fundamental human need for order and predictability, even in the fractured subterranean world.

Identity and Expression

Factions express their identity through a rich and varied language of symbols, marks, and communication, which serve to declare allegiance, assert control, and shape social cohesion.

Graffiti is the most pervasive form of factional expression. Slogans, emblems, or cryptic symbols are scrawled on walls, pillars, and ceilings, repeated until they become synonymous with a group’s presence. The style and density of graffiti vary widely among factions. Authoritarian factions often impose uniform markings, with strict color schemes and standardized symbols that convey order and discipline. In contrast, more chaotic or decentralized factions exhibit layered graffiti, where multiple hands add overlapping tags, slogans, and images, reflecting internal diversity and contested spaces.

Color plays a significant role where materials permit. Banners, dyed fabrics, or painted surfaces distinguish factions visually, reinforcing identity and aiding recognition in the dim subterranean environment. Some factions adopt obsessive marking practices, meticulously maintaining their symbols and erasing others’, while others apply marks sparingly, relying on oral traditions or ephemeral signs.

Signage—whether painted, carved, or posted on salvaged boards—proclaims rules, warnings, or territorial boundaries. These signs are not mere decoration; they function as legal and social instruments, communicating the faction’s norms and expectations to both members and outsiders.

Voice and text also contribute to identity. Slogans chanted in assemblies, broadcasts over speakers, or inscriptions etched into communal walls serve to reinforce collective memory and shared purpose. These expressions create a living language of allegiance, a performative act that sustains the faction’s presence in both physical and social space.

To erase or deface another faction’s marks is a potent act of denial and challenge, while the repetition of one’s own marks asserts permanence and legitimacy. Through these practices, identity is maintained not only in memory but on the very surfaces of the tunnels themselves.

Conclusion

Factions constitute the foundational frameworks of survival, politics, and social order in the subterranean world. They vary in form, scale, and legitimacy, yet all rest upon the same essential foundations of infrastructure, leadership, and a capital from which authority flows. Their persistence depends on the ability to justify their existence to followers, whether through control of resources, protection, ideology, or force.

The tension between instability and persistence defines the life of factions. Leadership crises, succession disputes, resource scarcity, and internal divisions constantly threaten their cohesion. Yet factions endure because humans cannot live without structure; they provide the only continuity amid the fractured and often hostile underground environment.

Factions are both destructive and constructive forces. They may foment violence, exclusion, and fragmentation, but they also create networks of cooperation, shared identity, and collective resilience. Their symbols cover the walls, their leaders rise and fall, and their capitals anchor the fragile continuity of society. To study factions is not to examine anomalies but to describe the necessary forms of order in a fractured world, revealing how humans adapt social organization to survive and shape their environment beneath the surface.
