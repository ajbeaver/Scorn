# ComponentIndex

This document defines the canonical design components of Scorn. Each component is limited in scope and authority. No component is permitted to be omniscient, centralize control, or privilege the player.

---

## 1) World-Scale Context
- Purpose: Establishes the global backdrop and long-horizon pressures of the setting.
- State ownership: Global conditions, directional entropy stance, and broad environmental constraints.
- Explicit non-responsibilities: Local outcomes, faction specifics, player fate, or immediate information availability.
- Allowed interactions: Informs Local-Scale Context; may be referenced by Informational Filter only as partial, indirect signals.

## 2) Local-Scale Context
- Purpose: Defines regional realities and the local envelopes of possibility.
- State ownership: Settlement presence, regional stability or fragility, and localized environmental conditions.
- Explicit non-responsibilities: Global destiny, player continuity, or authoritative narrative truth.
- Allowed interactions: Receives constraints from World-Scale Context; informs Social Order; may be observed by Informational Filter.

## 3) Social Order
- Purpose: Governs cultural meaning, legitimacy, and factional presence as lived systems.
- State ownership: Factional authority claims, cultural norms, rituals, and collective memory as a social fabric.
- Explicit non-responsibilities: Environmental determinism, player survival, or the integrity of objective truth.
- Allowed interactions: Shapes Informational Filter; reacts to Local-Scale Context; may influence Player Perspective only indirectly through meaning and constraint.

## 4) Informational Filter
- Purpose: Constrains perception and prevents omniscient access to systemic truth.
- State ownership: The framing, partiality, delay, noise, degradation, and symbolism of information available to the player.
- Explicit non-responsibilities: Underlying systemic reality, global or local outcomes, or player survival.
- Allowed interactions: Observes World-Scale Context, Local-Scale Context, and Social Order in partial form; shapes Player Perspective without guaranteeing clarity.

## 5) Player Perspective
- Purpose: Represents the player’s lived experience within constraints of vulnerability and uncertainty.
- State ownership: The player’s present context, contingent understanding, and fragile continuity.
- Explicit non-responsibilities: World autonomy, systemic truth, or authoritative narrative control.
- Allowed interactions: Receives information from Informational Filter; may affect Local-Scale Context and Social Order only through situated presence, never as a privileged axis.

## 6) Continuity Ledger
- Purpose: Ensures persistence of world consequences without privileging player continuity.
- State ownership: Enduring world consequences, social memory traces, and the continuity of global/local trajectories.
- Explicit non-responsibilities: Player immortality, clean resets, or correction of entropy.
- Allowed interactions: Maintains World-Scale Context and Local-Scale Context persistence; provides Social Order with memory traces; does not interface directly with Player Perspective.

## 7) Boundary Contract
- Purpose: Enforces the design constraints and prevents unauthorized additions.
- State ownership: The explicit non-goals, prohibitions, and domain separation rules.
- Explicit non-responsibilities: Any narrative, systemic, or informational state beyond constraint enforcement.
- Allowed interactions: Governs all components by restricting scope; does not produce information for Player Perspective.
