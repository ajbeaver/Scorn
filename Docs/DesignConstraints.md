# Scorn Design Constraints and Non-Goals

This document is a binding contract for future AI coding agents. These constraints are mandatory. Do not interpret them as suggestions.

## What Scorn Is Trying To Be
- A hostile survival game where the world is alive, indifferent, and autonomous.
- A terminal-like experience that uses intentional panels, headers, banners, and visualizations without representing the player as a sprite, avatar, or ASCII character.
- A game that exposes depth directly through consequences, language, and partial information rather than explicit meters, tutorials, or optimization prompts.
- A setting where the player begins with missing memory and missing context, and meaning is uncovered only through survival, attention, and engagement.
- A world shaped by long-term systemic collapse, fragmented authority, and local adaptation rather than scripted events or cinematic spectacle.
- A narrative space where the player’s origin as part of a destructive system is canonical to the setting but not guaranteed to be discovered in any given playthrough.

## What Scorn Explicitly Refuses To Be
- Flashy graphics or spectacle as a hook.
- A power fantasy, hero story, or triumphalist survival tale.
- A game that guarantees survival, redemption, or moral virtue.
- A game with invisible safety nets or fake agency.
- A game that hides systemic depth behind abstraction or sugarcoated interfaces.
- A game that uses tutorialization to teach optimal play.
- A game that adds “gamey” filler systems or activities for engagement padding.

## Rules: Player Agency, Survival, and Expendability
- Survival is not guaranteed, not virtuous, and not always desirable.
- On all but easy difficulty, the odds are heavily stacked against survival.
- Failure and death are expected outcomes and must be narratively meaningful without being softened.
- The player is never represented as a character sprite, avatar, or ASCII proxy.
- The player’s capacity to uncover truths, including their origin, is contingent on action, survival, and engagement; no revelation is mandatory.
- Do not frame the player as central or protected by the world; the world persists independently of the player’s success or failure.

## Rules: UI, Perception, and Information Access
- The interface may use dashboards, panels, maps, banners, headers, and visualizations only when diegetically justified.
- The interface must never provide a clean, omniscient, or frictionless view of systemic truth.
- Information may be noisy, delayed, partial, degraded, symbolic, or contradictory.
- Do not present explicit resource meters or abstract numerical status readouts without a diegetic explanation.
- Do not use tutorials, tips, or prompts that explain optimal play or reveal hidden system logic.

## Rules: World Autonomy, Entropy, and Scale
- The world exists and evolves independently of the player.
- Large-scale dynamics (populations, migration, collapse, recovery) emerge from local rules, not scripted events.
- The world is not scripted toward total collapse or guaranteed recovery.
- Local systems may stabilize or endure for long periods.
- Globally, entropy trends negative without sustained intervention, but outcomes are uneven and contingent rather than absolute.

## Non-Goals and Forbidden Additions
Future agents are forbidden from inventing or “helpfully adding” any of the following unless explicitly instructed by the user:
- New mechanics, features, systems, or loops.
- Visual spectacle, cinematic sequences, or graphical hooks.
- Omniscient UI layers, clean dashboards that expose total system truth, or frictionless information feeds.
- Safety nets, soft-failure modes, or hidden protections that guarantee survivability.
- Linear narrative arcs, mandatory revelations, or scripted story beats.
- Abstractions that hide consequence, reduce uncertainty, or present the world as solvable.
- Tutorialization or guidance that teaches optimal play or encourages optimization.
- “Gamey” filler content or engagement padding.

## Compliance Requirement
When asked to produce design work for Scorn, all agents must comply with this document. If a requested change conflicts with these constraints, the agent must explicitly ask for confirmation to override them before proceeding.

## Canonical Design Authority and Ordering

- `DesignConstraints.md` is the highest-authority document in this repository.
- No design, system, mechanic, UI element, or narrative structure may contradict this document without explicit user approval.

Design work for Scorn must proceed in a deliberate order:
1. World-scale constraints and entropy direction
2. Local-scale possibility boundaries
3. Social order and legitimacy constraints
4. Informational and perceptual limits
5. Player-scale framing and vulnerability

Agents are forbidden from designing downstream domains before upstream constraints are established and accepted.

Rationale:
- This ordering prevents the player, UI, or mechanics from shaping the world retroactively.
- World autonomy and uncertainty must remain primary; player affordances are always derived, never foundational.
- Violations of design order are considered violations of intent, not efficiency improvements.

If a task requires breaking this ordering, the agent must stop and request explicit confirmation before proceeding.
