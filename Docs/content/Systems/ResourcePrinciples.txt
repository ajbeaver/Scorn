Resource Principles — Canon

This document defines the universal laws governing all resources in the Scorn simulation.
These principles are invariant. Individual resources differ only by parameters, not rules.

No resource is special-cased.

Core Lifecycle (Applies to Every Resource)

1. Production exists only via infrastructure
   - Resources do not appear naturally or passively.
   - All production is mediated by physical or social nodes.

2. Infrastructure always degrades
   - Every node has a condition value that trends downward over time.
   - Inactivity may slow decay but never halts it.

3. Maintenance counters, but never eliminates, degradation
   - Maintenance consumes labor and other resources.
   - Maintenance restores condition partially and temporarily.
   - Perfect upkeep is impossible.

4. Expansion increases output and maintenance burden
   - Adding nodes raises production capacity.
   - Each new node adds ongoing maintenance cost and failure surface.

5. Self-sustainability is achieved, not default
   - A system is self-sustaining only if it can pay the full cost of its own upkeep.
   - Surplus is fragile and contingent, not permanent.

Canonical Resource Set (Foundational)

The following resources exist at the base simulation layer.
Each obeys the full lifecycle above.

Physical Resources

• Water  
  - Node: pump / intake system  
  - Consumed by: population, maintenance, production nodes  

• Food  
  - Node: fungal vat / grow system  
  - Consumed by: population, labor recovery  

• Power  
  - Node: generator / energy rig  
  - Consumed by: all active infrastructure  

• Air  
  - Node: filter array / circulation system  
  - Consumed by: population, enclosed space  

Structural Resources

• Space  
  - Node: habitable chambers / tunnels  
  - Consumed by: population, infrastructure density  
  - Degrades via collapse risk, contamination, overuse  

• Materials  
  - Node: stockpiles / salvage depots  
  - Consumed by: maintenance, repairs, expansion  
  - Degrades via corrosion, loss, diversion  

Human Resources

• Labor  
  - Node: workforce / crews / shifts  
  - Consumed by: production, maintenance, governance  
  - Degrades via exhaustion, injury, morale loss  

Abstract but Material Resources

• Knowledge  
  - Node: archives, scribes, training systems  
  - Consumed by: maintenance efficiency, recovery speed  
  - Degrades via loss, death, censorship, neglect  

• Legitimacy  
  - Node: institutions, councils, enforcement bodies  
  - Consumed by: governance actions, coercion, crisis response  
  - Degrades via unmet needs, repression, prolonged strain

Invariant Constraints

• No resource regenerates without infrastructure.
• No infrastructure persists without maintenance.
• No maintenance is free.
• No expansion reduces long-term complexity.
• No system is independent of labor.

Any mechanic that violates one of these constraints is invalid.

Design Notes (Non-Executable)

• Resources may depend on one another asymmetrically.
• Abstract resources are treated with the same rigor as physical ones.
• Later systems (trade, military, culture, currency) must consume from this set.
• This document defines physics, not balance.
